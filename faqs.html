                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <h2>We would like to take lessons for our upcoming wedding. How soon should we start?</h2>
                <p>It's never too early to start taking lessons, even if you just want something simple. Although you may learn quickly, the sooner you are comfortable with even a few basic steps, the more time you have to practice and feel confident. By starting early, you have time to schedule a few extra lessons (if you decide you need them) without feeling too much last-minute pressure.</p>

                <h2>How many lessons will we need to learn our wedding dance?</h2>
                <p>Every couple is different, and everyone learns at a different pace. For most couples, five lessons is enough to be comfortable improvising with a basic step, some variations and a turn or two: enough to get through a fairly short song. I have personally observed that simple basics tend to "click" around lesson three, and then the real learning begins!</p>

                <p>Additional lessons will provide you with a much more polished look and a greater variety of steps to make things more fun and interesting! Many of my couples do five to ten or more lessons!</p>

                <h2>What shoes should I wear?</h2>
                <p>For safety reasons, I recommend avoiding flip-flops. Loose sandals are not secure on your feet and can create a tripping hazard. I also suggest avoiding gym shoes since they are often bulky, and rubber soles stick to the floor and make movement difficult. Comfortable, well-secured shoes that can slide on a wooden floor are best. Ladies may want to wear flats or a comfortable pair of heels (not too high, without a platform). Dress shoes, or dressy-casual shoes work well for the gentlemen. The idea is to wear something that is comfortable and supportive, and most importantly allows your feet to articulate naturally.</p>

                <p>Nothing beats a pair of shoes designed for dancing. If you plan on advancing and continuing to dance socially, you will want to invest in a good pair of dance shoes.</p>

                <h2>Is there a cancellation policy?</h2>
                <p>Yes. I ask that clients give at least 24 hours notice before cancelling a lesson. Appointment times are limited, and last-minute cancellations are unfair to others who may have been turned down for the same appointment. They are unfair to the instructor as well who pays to rent studio space, and may still be responsible for those fees even if a client cancels. Same-day cancellations and "no-shows" will be subject to forfeiture or rescheduling fee.</p>

                <h2>I don't have a wedding or special event coming up, but I'm interested in learning to dance just in general. What should I learn?</h2>
                <p>Some people already know what style they'd like to learn, but if you're not sure where to start, here are some ideas: Think about the kinds of music that you like, or think about situations or venues where you'd like to be able to dance. If you like high-energy music and you'd like to frequent Latin dancing venues, Salsa and Bachata will be most useful. If you're not sure where you'd want to use your dance skills, but want to be able to adapt to different styles of music (such as at a wedding, on a cruise, holiday parties, etc.), general ballroom styles (waltz, foxtrot, rumba) are a good place to start. If you want something different and artistic, Argentine Tango is a fulfilling challenge!</p>
