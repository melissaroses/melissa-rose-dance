                <h1>Lessons in Seattle, WA</h1>
                <p>Seattle and the surrounding areas have a vibrant social dancing scene, and there is no shortage of opportunities to enjoy live music, dance clubs and events any night of the week.</p>

                <p>Iâ€‹f you're looking for a fun way to make new friends, improve your confidence or get in better shape, dance lessons may be for you.</p>

                <p>The most essential element of any dance style is the connection between the leader and follower. With a focus on this connection and proper communication, Melissa Rose can teach you how to feel comfortable and move naturally on the dance floor.</p>

                <p>Singles and couples are welcome, and special package prices are available.</p>

                <h1>Online Lessons</h1>
                <p>For some who are new to dancing, the footwork can be the hardest part of getting started, and sometimes it can be difficult to concentrate on technique, or the connection with your partner, when you're worried about your feet. Sometimes, going to a group class can be intimidating - perhaps the instructor moves quickly, or there are a lot of people in the class with various levels of experience.</p>

                <p>Considering this, some clients like to get a head start with just the footwork, basic steps, and principles of body movement via a few video lessons (in the comfort of their own home) before going to a class. That way, you already have an idea of what the rhythm and steps are like, and you can concentrate on technique, form, leading or following, and connection when you decide to join the class. </p>

                <p>Because of the limitations of a video lesson (primarily the lack of tactile feedback from an instructor demonstrating how a movement or a response should feel), I offer online lessons at a discounted rate.</p>
